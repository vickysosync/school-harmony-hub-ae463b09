initial prompt

Build a complete, modern, professional and fully functional **School Management Portal / School ERP** using ONLY:

* React

* Vite

* Tailwind CSS

Do NOT use Next.js.

Do NOT use plain HTML/CSS/Vanilla JavaScript architecture.

Do NOT use unnecessary frameworks or backend technologies.

Use React components, React hooks, Context/API-style service layers and reusable components throughout the application.

For the frontend demo version, use **LocalStorage** for persistent data. Do NOT use Firebase, Supabase, MySQL, MongoDB or any external database.

The application must be fully responsive and should feel like a real commercial School ERP/SaaS product, not a basic demo.

## 1. APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE

Create a clean modular React + Vite architecture such as:

src/

* components/

* layouts/

* pages/

* modules/

* hooks/

* context/

* services/

* utils/

* data/

* types/

* assets/

Use reusable components for:

* Sidebar

* Topbar

* Dashboard Cards

* Data Tables

* Search

* Filters

* Pagination

* Modal

* Forms

* Confirmation Dialog

* Toast Notifications

* Dropdowns

* Tabs

* Document Preview

* A4 Document Layout

Done this session: all shared repo files are in place (login, dashboard, students, admissions, attendance, exams/report card, fees, certificates, teachers/staff/payroll), plus new timetable/classes/subjects/assign-teacher pages, the six reports pages, and notices with WhatsApp-ready parent messages.

Still remaining: the small wiring file that connects each menu item to its screen (src/modules/registry.tsx) and the Settings pages (school profile, user management, backup/restore). Until the wiring file exists the app won't build — that's the one error showing now. Ask me to continue when you're topped up and I'll finish those two items straight away.
